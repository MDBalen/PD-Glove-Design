In presenting documents and information on this site, I am not advocating for any particular glove design. Likewise, I am not advocating for people with Parkinson's to use DIY glove therapy. The informed choices of whether to proceed with a DIY glove, and if so what design to choose, should be made by each individual in consideration of their personal circumstances and disposition, and only after consultation with their doctors. This is particularly true for people who have DBS or pacemakers and have to consider special precautions around all electronics. There is no guarentee implied or explicit that following any of the information presented here will enable a user to build an effective device that will deliver any expected results.
